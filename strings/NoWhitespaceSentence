/*
Lets say someone accidentally deleted all the whitespaces from a sentence. 
Write a program to reconstruct the sentence from that stripped out string. 
Assume you have access to a dictionary function that returns if a given string is a valid word or not. 

Example input: thisisavalidsentence 
Output: this is a valid sentence 

If multiple solutions are possible, any one valid solution should be given. 
Assume there is always a valid solution. No invalid input will be given.

We need to handle the situation where one word starts with another word.
For example, input = herewego
Since "he" is a valid word, we don't want the program to fail after finding "he".
The output should be "here we go"
